    This dashboard is built with the aim of transforming complex economic data into accessible, interactive visualizations that anyone can understand and explore. Economic inequality is a pressing global issue, but understanding it often requires navigating dense data sets and technical jargon. This project seeks to bridge that gap by presenting critical data in a way that is clear, engaging, and actionable.

    We use the data sources of the **World Bank** and the **World Income Inequality Database (WIID)** to provide insights into various economic indicators. Through our visualizations, you can explore topics such as:

    - **GDP Trends**: Understand how the GDP deflator has changed over time and across countries, offering a glimpse into inflationary trends and economic growth.
    - **Gini Coefficient**: Dive into one of the most commonly used measures of income inequality, comparing how wealth is distributed across different nations.
    - **Poverty Ratios**: Examine poverty levels globally, specifically focusing on the percentage of populations living under $2.15 a day (2017 PPP). 
    - **Income Quintiles**: Visualize the distribution of income within countries to understand inequality at a granular level.
    - **Income Inequality Ratios**: Analyze changes in income disparity over time to identify trends and patterns.
    - **Inequality Chatbot**: Engage with an AI chatbot to learn more about economic inequality, its causes, and potential solutions in an interactive way.

    At its core, this project aims to make global inequality data more approachable and useful to people from diverse backgrounds. Whether you're a policymaker looking to shape impactful strategies, a student wanting to deepen your understanding of inequality, or simply a curious individual, this dashboard is here to support your journey of discovery.
