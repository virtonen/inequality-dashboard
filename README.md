### About the Project
This dashboard is built with the aim of transforming complex economic data into accessible, interactive visualizations that anyone can understand and explore. Economic inequality is a pressing issue, and through our visualizations, you can explore various economic indicators using data from the World Bank and the World Income Inequality Database (WIID).

- **GDP Trends**: Understand how the GDP deflator has changed over time and across countries, offering a glimpse into inflationary trends and economic growth.
- **Gini Coefficient**: Dive into one of the most commonly used measures of income inequality, comparing how wealth is distributed across different nations.
- **Poverty Ratios**: Examine poverty levels globally, specifically focusing on the percentage of populations living under $2.15 a day (2017 PPP).
- **Income Quintiles**: Visualize the distribution of income within countries to understand inequality at a granular level.
- **Income Inequality Ratios**: Analyze changes in income disparity over time to identify trends and patterns.
- **Inequality Chatbot**: Engage with an AI chatbot to learn more about economic inequality, its causes, and potential solutions in an interactive way.

At its core, this project aims to make global inequality data more approachable and useful to people from diverse backgrounds. Whether you're a policymaker looking to shape impactful strategies, a researcher, a student, or just a curious individual, this dashboard is designed for you.
